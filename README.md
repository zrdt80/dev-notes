# ðŸ§  Developer Notes

This is my personal dev-log and technical knowledge repo.  
I use it to track what I'm learning, organize projects, and store snippets or tricks I find useful.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

-   `DEVLOG.md` â€“ daily coding progress and decisions
-   `PROJECTS.md` â€“ current project goals, milestones and changelogs
-   `NOTES/` â€“ documentation and dev notes (git, flask, docker etc.)
-   `SNIPPETS.md` â€“ reusable code blocks and helpers
